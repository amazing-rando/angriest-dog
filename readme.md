# The Angriest Dog in the World Comic Creator

[The Angriest Dog in the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angriest_Dog_in_the_World) was one of the first popular [constrained comic strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_comics).  This strip is marked by the absurdist humor of its creator, film director [David Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch).

Given that this comic strip was in limited syndication and has long been out of print, I thought that it would be fun to write software that would generate new Angriest Dog comics.  To this end, I've trained a Markov-chain model on a set of short jokes scraped from all over the web and use this model to generate novel comics.
